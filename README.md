# Nostreon API

Public API for third-party Nostr clients to integrate creator subscriptions.

Nostreon is a creator subscription platform on Nostr and Bitcoin. This API lets any Nostr client (Primal, Damus, Amethyst, etc.) embed subscription creation natively so their users can subscribe to creators without leaving the app.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fetch a creator's tiers (no auth required)
curl https://nostreon.com/api/v1/creators/npub1.../tiers

# 2. Subscribe a user (requires API key + NIP-98 signed event)
curl -X POST https://nostreon.com/api/v1/subscribe \
  -H "Authorization: Nostr <base64_signed_event>" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <your_api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tier_id": "...", "billing": "monthly"}'

# 3. Poll for payment (after user pays the Lightning invoice)
curl "https://nostreon.com/api/v1/subscribe/status?invoice_id=..." \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <your_api_key>"
```

## How it Works

```

  invoice in          invoice         invoice             via Lightning
  your UI
```

1. Your client calls `POST /v1/subscribe` with a signed NIP-98 event and API key
2. Nostreon creates a BTCPay invoice and returns a BOLT11 Lightning invoice
3. Your client displays the QR code / invoice for the user to pay
4. When payment settles, Nostreon automatically creates the subscription, publishes a NIP-63 membership event, and pays the creator
5. The user can now access premium content from any NIP-63 compatible relay

## Documentation

**Reference**
- [Authentication](./authentication.md) — API keys and NIP-98 HTTP auth
- [Creators](./endpoints/creators.md) — fetch profiles and tiers
- [Subscriptions](./endpoints/subscriptions.md) — create and poll subscriptions

**Generic examples** (any HTTP-capable client)
- [Node.js](./examples/nodejs/) — full subscription flow with NIP-98 signing
- [Browser](./examples/browser/) — vanilla JavaScript integration

**Client-specific examples** (idiomatic for each Nostr client)
- [Primal](./examples/primal/) — web/iOS/Android, integrates with Primal Wallet for one-tap payment
- [Damus](./examples/damus/) — iOS Swift, hands off payment to the user's Lightning wallet via `lightning:` URI
- [Amethyst](./examples/amethyst/) — Android Kotlin, opens the user's Lightning wallet via Android intent

Each client example walks through the full flow (discover tiers → sign auth event → create invoice → handle payment → poll for settlement) using the language and patterns idiomatic to that client. The HTTP API is identical regardless of which client you're integrating into; the examples differ in how they sign events, how they pay invoices, and how they show subscription state to the user.

## Revenue Share

Nostreon takes a 5% platform fee on subscriptions. When a subscription is created through your API integration, Nostreon shares 50% of the platform fee with you (configurable per partner).

**Example on a $5/month subscription:**
- Creator gets: $4.75 (95%)
- Nostreon gets: $0.125 (2.5%)
- Your client gets: $0.125 (2.5%)

Payouts are sent automatically to your Lightning address on each successful subscription.

## Get an API Key

API keys come in two flavors:

- **Test keys** (`npk_test_*`) — for development against `dev.nostreon.com`. BTCPay is skipped entirely; invoices are mocked and auto-settle on polling. No money moves, but real subscription records and kind 1163 membership events are created in the dev environment so you can test your full integration.
- **Live keys** (`npk_live_*`) — for production against `nostreon.com`. Real invoices, real payments, real payouts.

We recommend starting with a test key, building your integration, then requesting a live key once everything works end-to-end. See [authentication.md](./authentication.md#key-types) for full details on test mode.

To request a key, [open an issue](https://github.com/Nostreon/api-docs/issues/new) in this repo with:

- Client name
- **Your npub** (we'll deliver the API key via Nostr DM, never in the issue)
- Lightning address for receiving referral payouts
- Which key you want: `test`, `live`, or `both`
- Expected monthly volume (optional)

We'll reply in the issue to confirm receipt, then send the API key to your npub as an encrypted Nostr direct message (NIP-04). Never share API keys in public channels.

## Base URL

- **Production**: `https://nostreon.com/api/v1`
- **Staging**: `https://dev.nostreon.com/api/v1`

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint type | Default limit |
|---|---|
| Read-only (no auth) | 60 requests / minute per IP |
| Authenticated (with API key) | 30 requests / minute per API key |

Rate limits are configurable per partner. If you need higher limits, contact us.

Rate-limited responses return HTTP 429 with a `Retry-After` header.

## Errors

All errors return JSON with an `error` field:

```json
{ "error": "Invalid or inactive API key" }
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `400` | Bad request (invalid parameters) |
| `401` | Missing or invalid authentication |
| `404` | Resource not found |
| `429` | Rate limited |
| `500` | Server error |
